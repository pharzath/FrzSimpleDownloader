A lot of people are crazy, cruel and negative. They got a little too much time on their hands to discuss everybody else. I have a limited amount of energy to blow in a day. I'd rather read something that I like or watch a program I enjoy or ride my damn motorcycle or throw back a couple of shots of tequila with my friends.
A lot of writers whom I love, admire and call friends share this feeling, which is this fundamental idea that we're frauds. That we will be pushed out on to the stage, and it will be revealed that the emperor has no clothes.

Adam Sandler, Mike Myers, Dava Carvey, Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell - they're all the best.
All I ever wanted to do was get a great job on a TV show. When I read 'Modern Family' and started looking at what was available - I obviously couldn't play Gloria; I couldn't play Claire.

After my last audition for 'Game of Thrones,' they said, 'Congratulations, princess.' I was like, 'Bye-bye, call centre.

Amy Poehler, Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph - when they speak, everyone listens. Because they're freaking hilarious.
America I'm putting my queer shoulder to the wheel.
American histories were the same; they had these mad ideas about how Parliament worked, or what people really meant when they said A, B, or C. All my life, I felt simultaneously deracinated and rooted in both places, and now it's my greatest strength: I'm culturally bilingual.
Amores Perros' and 'Once Were Warriors' had a tremendous visceral quality that really influenced me.

Amy Adams was great to work with, fun and lovely.
Amy Rapp, my producing partner, and I are drawn to character-driven material. We're developing and producing movies and TV, fiction and non-fiction, studio and independent, broadcast and cable, theatre, and web so our slate is really diverse.
Anna Held's birthdate and hometown are a dark mystery, thanks to her own mythmaking.
Anna Katherine Green wrote about a female inquiry agent, and there were a scattering of female investigators in the 1970s, authored by men, who just didn't ring true. So I thought, 'Well, there's an opening here for something.
Amy Carter, Chelsea Clinton and the Obama girls all had to change schools.
And that's one thing that helps me is I learn it blandly, vanilla, then I don't try to act it too soon because you start to act it, and you kind of go away from what the next sentence is, what the next paragraph is. So get it down so it kind of can - it's in there so you can then, as I call it, dance on top of it.
And so from that, I've always been fascinated with the idea that complexity can come out of such simplicity.
Appreciation is the highest form of prayer, for it acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts.
Anna Kournikova will always be better paid than Lindsay Davenport. The first left the circuit without having won a single title while the second was world number one.

Any time I go to a hospital, the doctors treat me like an equal, and I'm terrified I'll be in the delivery room, and the doctor will say, 'Noah. Noah, why don't you get a hand in here?' and I'll pass out or throw up and be horribly embarrassed.

Anna Magnani, Sophia Loren, Meryl Streep - I love actresses that are strong and fragile at the same time. They bring complexity to their roles.

As a Middle Eastern male, I know there's certain things I'm not supposed to say on an airplane in the U.S., right? I'm not supposed to be walking down the aisle, and be like, 'Hi, Jack.'

Because kids are physically smaller, there's an assumption by people who haven't read a kids' book for a long time that their ideas and themes and problems and ambitions must be commensurately smaller and less important. I would venture that sometimes the opposite is true.
Bunk' is better than 'Wheel of Fortune' because we have a wheel, just like them, but our wheel is purposeless. It doesn't do anything. It just spins for no reason. Which is nice because it frees our wheel up to really pursue its dream: becoming a professional paddlewheel.

By the time I was five, I was a little diva.

Billy Campbell who is... I... truly one of the most talented actors today.

By the mid-sixties, the United States had poured more than half a million troops into South Vietnam.

Dolly Parton... I love being around that woman! I worked really hard to keep up with her.

Envy the Night' was my first stand alone, the first book I'd written in the third person and I loved the feel of that, and it was different but it was also the same.

Everything that could produce a clash between the Arab world and the West seemed dangerous to me.
Every decision I make is, 'How is this helping me become a billionaire?

Fiancee' is a very fun word to say, because I never thought I would have a fiancee or be a fiancee. Sometimes when I would introduce myself and say, 'This is my girlfriend Melanie,' it wasn't always clear what I meant. Now I get to say, 'This is my fiancee Melanie.

Florence and art is something that is part of my life and is part of myself.
Galentine's Day is the day before Valentine's Day. People sometimes think, 'Oh, it's a replacement for Valentine's Day.' But it's not. You can celebrate Galentine's and Valentine's.

Fantasy was something I'd read as a child. And, in fact, my teachers despaired a little bit because I refused to give up Enid Blyton. Then I walked through the wardrobe with C. S.

Golf balls are sweet: dimpled and sometimes even smiling.
Food redistribution is one of the best win-win solutions for food waste avoidance. Food companies can often save money by donating food rather than paying the Ã‚Â£80 or so per tonne in landfill tax and disposal costs.

For me, it's always been draining to be around people for too long because I'm naturally a pretty expressionless person. From an early age, I found being alone incredibly liberating.

Free State of Jones' went beyond that.

It actually shows how complex these ideologies were on both sides.
A lot of times you have to dip into the independent world to find the really great projects and the really great scripts. They're out there - you just have to search hard.

Game of Thrones' is just incredible, what they pull off every week.
George Bush is by American standards rabidly Upper Class - Eastern, Socially Attractive, WASP, 19th-century money, several generations of Andover and Yale (and, while we're at it, his father, George H. W. 'Poppy' Bush, was a former president and his grandfather was the Nazis' U.S. banker in the 1930s).

I always say this: 'In life, truth is on your side.
Hellraiser' was the first horror film I ever saw, so it will always be a favorite.

Heath, I believed in him when I first met him, and helped and supported him. He went on to obvious success in the States and then I had him support me. It can be a lonely, horrible, hard place. It's great just to have someone to call to say 'I know, man, I was there
I always tell people, 'The music's free. I get paid to travel.

I can get a firestorm going anywhere in the United States by saying 'O.J.
I always said it was to be dumb enough to do what Marlon Perkins said to do.
I can't separate the process of writing from the visual process. I'm speaking only for myself here, but I'm a highly visual writer. In my imagination, when I'm thinking of a scene, I think of every last detail of it: The space, the color palette, the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera.
I completely think of myself as sexual. Completely and utterly. Probably more so than I did when I was 30. I don't know why. I'm very comfortable with how I look. I'm absolutely committed to never having anything done to my face. I would never let anyone near me with a Botox needle.

I did this one movie with a great director named Wayne Kramer. It was 'Crossing Over,' and Harrison Ford, Ashley Judd and Ray Liotta were in it. I was one of the leads, and I thought this was it. It got shelved for two years, and then it was in theaters maybe a week. After that, I adopted a philosophy of, 'Hope for the best, expect the worst.
I do admit that I've never been one to fit in easily to any given pattern. It's not my choice. It's just the way I am. So if the characters I wind up playing are all a bit different, it must be because that's the way I like it. Anna Kendrick is different, and she's going to stay that way.

I brought my first fall/winter line to New York, and it was confiscated by U.S. Customs. They asked, 'What is the value of this?' I said, 'I'm not so good with existential questions.
I don't desire happiness. I think it's a myth, and I don't think it's... and it makes you complacent. I feel very satisfyingly uncomfortable. I have the freedom to feel uncomfortable in the way I want to, is maybe a way to put it.
I don't have the proportions for 'hood hot.

I decided that if I want to write about a female hero in the 1920s, I'm going to have to give her all the advantages I can because she has serious disadvantages in being a woman. I wasn't going to have her cowed or overawed by class, so she had to be titled.

I got the pilot for 'Scrubs' sent to me, and in the margin for Dr. Cox, it said 'a John McGinley type.' So when I went in to audition, I said to Billy Lawrence, who's a dear friend of mine, I said, 'Well, I'm John McGinley.
I graduated from a place called Whitworth College in Spokane with a theater degree, then in 1993 I moved to L.A. and auditioned and did very well there.

I figured out something spiritual. Billboard this: 'Life is supposed to be fun!
I guess I'm a hopeful optimist, because to be a pessimist is to be suicidal.
I had a Super Beetle that I restored and painted deep purple in honor of Jimi Hendrix that was stolen.

I guess God made Boston on a wet Sunday.
I guess I have a strong constitution.
I guess men like me - somebody out there must think I'm hot.
I don't know what sex appeal is. I don't think you can have sex appeal knowingly. The people who seduce me personally are the people who seem not to know they're seductive, and not to know they have sex appeal.
I don't know Laura Bush. But she seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good.

I grew up as a kid looking at artists like David Bowie and Prince; I really admired them.
I grew up in a little town called Uckfield, and there's not much to do - so we used to fight a lot. I was never in serious trouble, but we used to have the local bobby round the house saying, 'Rory's been up to this again.
I grew up on Wu-Tang and Tribe and Nas, all the raw, very New York-driven music. Then when I got older - in my late teens, early twenties - and that's when I started to listen to Drake and J. Cole, and so it wasn't just East-coast.
I imagine Heaven would have very nice weather - perfect climate where you can wear a leather jacket or shorts and a sweater.
I knew exactly what I wanted to do since I could remember. As a kid, if my friends came round after school for dinner, I'd put on shows; I'd write plays and charge the parents Ã‚Â£1.50 for a ticket for sweetie money.

I just cash in on the fact that I'm good looking, and I've got a nice figure and girls like me.
I knew I wanted to write professionally and get paid.
I know 150 percent how deeply cynical and negative I can be. I can be very dark and harsh.
I knew that if I were the best in the world, my reality could change. I was always the person who didn't conform to the idea of 'halfway.
I know that we're being inexorably taken over by the Americans. Without a doubt. I don't mean invaded or anything like that, just taken over. By degrees.
I know there is a Supreme Being who rules the affairs of men and whose goodness and mercy have always followed the American people, and I know He will not turn from us now if we humbly and reverently seek His powerful aid.
I grew up looking up to DJ Premier, who would have the illest hip-hop joint on everybody's album.
I learned at a very early age that life is a battle. My family was poor, my neighborhood was poor. The only way that I could get away from the awfulness of life, at that time, was at the movies. There I decided that my big aim was to make money. And it was there that I became a very determined woman.
I knew President Yeltsin well. He would never have tolerated government officials demonstratively showing off the millions they acquired through corruption, the way it's done today.
I know all I really wanna do is get money and take care of my family.
I have always been cursed or blessed with this inability to hide behind anything and to just say exactly what I am experiencing.

I just watched a ton of comedy and saw a ton of different styles, and eventually you think, 'Oh, yeah, I could be like that.
I have aspirations to try and compete professionally. Any golfer that competes in tournaments would be lying if they said they didn't.
I learned that moral courage is harder than physical courage.
I know some of you don't care about food stamps, but I'm telling you if it feeds children, you do care about it.
I hate prejudice, discrimination, and snobbishness of any kind - it always reflects on the person judging and not the person being judged. Everyone should be treated equally.
I like L.A. It's like a mini break. For a writer, it's hilarious. Like the food. Where I come from, we eat chip sandwiches: white bread, butter, tomato catsup and big fat french fries. It's delicious. Here, you order a creme caramel and the waiter says, 'You know, that contains dairy.
I have an ethics background. It doesn't mean you're perfect. But I tried to set an entirely different bar for politics in D.C. that's based on ethics and first principles and political philosophy, and not this constant bickering of, 'Are you Right or Left?
I love heels. I remember the first time I saw a pair of heels my mum said: 'You're not wearing those. They're too high!
I love Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Miguel.
I love disagreements. I love the democratic process. If I'm in a room where everybody agrees, I start to nod off.
I love pop and rap. Bringing those two worlds together is always fun.
I have an internal protectiveness where it's like, if it comes to just me, as frightened as I am of losing someone I love or things going sour or simply being alone, there is a dark place in my brain where I'm like, It could happen and I'm okay, I'm prepared.
I need to put myself out in the world and be brave and be uncomfortable. When I do, it means I can enjoy life so much more.
I met my husband at the rehearsal of a play. We were introduced, and he shook my hand without looking at me and said perfunctorily, 'Pleased to meet you.

I realised how rich I had become and I asked myself, 'Do I really want to be the richest person in the cemetery?
I know, on 'Rick and Morty,' we had the time where they unfreeze time, and they're in trouble because of it. The time starts splitting. That episode, we got a little too focused on 'how,' the hows and the science behind it, and oh my God, it was - it was spiraling us for sure.
I refer to myself as 'we.
I never do anything fun, because I'm a housewife. I hate that word 'housewife.' I prefer to be called 'domestic goddess.

I like to go dancing, have a few beers. I like being alone, too. I have days where it's 'God, get me a shot of tequila.
I saw an amazing film when I was 16 called 'Slam'. It's about a spoken-word poet. Saul Williams is in it.
I saw 'Hairspray' at the Pantages in L.A. It came to the Pantages right before I did the movie, and just being in New York sometimes and seeing the marquees and everything like that, I'm like, 'I really, really have to go experience a Broadway play.
I never thought I would do a game show, but now I guess I'm now officially in that genre.
I see myself as a former politician, and in that capacity, I say to other politicians, 'Hold back.
I never really had the fun teens of exploring the world because I was sitting at home, learning programming.
I often say flippantly that the short story is... shorter; you can be done with it more easily. It's much less of a commitment of time and energy than a big project like a novel or long nonfiction book.
I never woke up and thought, 'I really want to live a bold life.
I once said to my father, when I was a boy, 'Dad we need a third political party.' He said to me, 'I'll settle for a second.

I live my life on self-belief and I live it partly on going with the flow.
I remember when the candle shop burned down. Everyone stood around singing 'Happy Birthday.

I think I invented the phrase 'Don't overdo it.
I listen to a lot of Tupac and Biggie Smalls. Old school songs. Rick Ross. I listen to a guy ASAP Rocky. I like different kinds of music. I always have. It motivates me before games... A Tupac playlist or a Meek Mill playlist. It varies.
I still have to count on my hands! I'll be in a restaurant doing a tip and I'll be like, 'What's 20% of this?
I still will sit down at the piano and play when I am wrestling with something emotionally or just want to move into the musical world.
I sometimes improvise, and that's what I call 'massaging the character.
I spent a lot of time listening to people. But it's also true that I liked details and listening to people when I was a bartender and when I was a waitress and probably when I was a babysitter as well. I suspect that's part of what drew me to psychotherapy rather than the other way around.
I made my kids into Viking fans, so they will carry their misery with them, too. A little disappointment in life goes a long way.

I love mixing prints. The costume designer for 'Pair of Kings' and I have actually incorporated the trend for my character 'Mikayla.

I love 'Star Trek: Voyager!
I think I honestly invented my own genre, the historical spy novel.
I never want kids to walk away after a school presentation and say, 'I met a writer today.' I want them to say, 'I am a writer.

I think that the 21st century will be feminine, that it's women who will, perhaps, find a way out for this world.
I think the biggest challenge we faced in making 'The September Issue' was the fact that people in the fashion world are very suspicious of cameras. They're used to a camera being the enemy, something that is prying and looking to catch you in a compromising position, something that's judging you.
I never know if I'm the builder or architect. The role shifts all the time. But what I have come to conclude is that the script is the muse.
I think the ongoing discussion of the world of advertising is, 'Where is the soul in advertising?
I often feel like not writing! Sometimes I overcome it by just sitting there until writing happens. Sometimes I don't write, because books often need periods of percolation.
I really love Scrabble. I played it with my mother growing up. We took it everywhere with us. We didn't know then about the two letter words. Who knew that AA, or more controversially, ZA, or QI were words? We were a games family generally.
I really think me and my family live humbly. I've secured my life, and I won't have to open the newspaper and be looking for work.

I sometimes look around that studio in the middle of commercials and think, 'Really?

I was a very religious child - I went to synagogue at least once, sometimes twice, a day. And I remember my religiousness as good - I think religion is good for children, especially educated children, because it allows for imagination, a whole imaginative world apart from the practical world.
I think I hit the bottom when my wife left me while I was on the road.
I think of a piece, and then people who are competent fabricate it. But lately I've started finger painting, which probably should be a joke but isn't!
I was born in L.A. County Hospital, but I grew up in Pasadena. I married my 8th grade sweetheart, Marcia.
I want people to think about movies and how we watch them. Let them know it's okay to question the structure or how we're sometimes duped into a false sense of normalcy.

I went through a whole blues period in the Nineties, and that had some influence on 'Load' and 'ReLoad.
I was lucky enough to have great mentors both in the culinary world and in the world of chefs who became celebrities. Bobby Flay is one of my dearest friends and a tremendous mentor for me. Mario Batali is the same way. They began doing TV a little before me and they showed me the way.
I was on the soap opera 'Days of our Lives.
I think the first role I ever played was Mr. Bumble in a production of 'Oliver.
I think improvisation is a technique and a tool. I think that even the best of them fail most of the time, and in the end, the audience is not interested in how you got there but in what you're saying. The more clearly and concisely and artistically you say it, the more effective it is.
I worked with Snoop, but I would love to work with him again, but DMX... I would love to work with him as well... I met him in Atlanta; I went to one of his concerts; I would love to do a song with him. I respect him and really like his music.
I think journalism gets measured by the quality of information it presents, not the drama or the pyrotechnics associated with us.

I use Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream, Ã‚Â£12, on my lips, and my arms if they're sunburned. I'm past caring that sunbathing is dangerous.

I was not bitter by not being allowed to play in the major leagues. I just said, 'The time has not come.
I think the thing about film is, as it gets proved by a lot of young filmmakers now, that the medium will just go on reinventing itself, and so you just hope to be a part of that and not a part of some kind of endless regurgitation or 'Here I am doing what you know I do' kind of thing.
I try to consider each body of work on its own terms, discretely, so terms like 'sculpture' or 'photography', in their broad sense, don't really enter into my thinking.
I was raised in a very religious household - it wasn't dogma, but we were raised Christian; we went to church every Sunday, Bible study, Bible camp every summer.
I was so besotted with '8Ã‚Â½' that, when it was on TV, I used to take pictures with my 35-mm. camera of the frames of the film. That was the first time I'd ever really seen Italians on screen.
If I fancy a girl, I'll tell her. I'll say: 'You're fit.
I think you have to be a little bit strict. You can't be friend and their parent in a lot of situations, especially in this day and age where it's so dangerous for kids. So there's a bit of sternness, I guess, in the way I raise my kids.
I walk into rooms and I don't know why I'm there. I'm like, 'Why am I standing in front of the toilet now?
I was 15 when I got my first job as a proofreader for an advertising agency in the City, earning Ã‚Â£12 a week.

If one of two lovers is loyal, and the other jealous and false, how may their friendship last, for Love is slain!
I want to do all types of music, music for all people. I want my music to be encouraging, to help people.

I try to live my life every day in the present, and try not to turn a blind eye to injustice and need.
I used to be more of a purist about literature. I thought, 'If it's a really propulsive story, then maybe there's something unliterary about it.

I would get scripts about 'a young swinging bachelor on the make,' and I said, 'No, I've done that.

If I were to try to describe the way in which I write, the only word I would use without qualification is 'slowly.

If Singapore is a nanny state, then I am proud to have fostered one.
If Trump wants to corruptly direct the conduct of an investigation in order to out an FBI source who was helping our government investigate Russian interference in our electoral processes, well, Article II of the Constitution begins with these terrifying words: 'The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.
If the United States is the melting pot of the world, you need entertainment - you need visuals that represent that.

I was not aware of a ton of the stuff that was being said about me out in the world since I wasn't able to get British or American headlines from my prison cell in Perugia. But I was aware that in the courtroom, I was being called a succubus, a man-eater, 'Foxy Knoxy.

I'm 300 pounds. If I fall on anybody, it's going to hurt.

I wrote and directed a movie called 'Two - Bit Waltz'. We just wrapped. It was a blast, blast, blast.

I'm excited for the audiences to hear the title track, 'Cheers to the Fall,' plus 'Red Flags' and 'Rearview.
I'm an old soul. I like the Nat King Cole; Sam Cooke is my favorite singer of all time. But I'm into neo-soul; I'm into R&B. Some of the modern stuff appeals to me, but most of it comes from an older time.
I wrote a 'Lenny Letter' on a whim, and it felt indulgent, but people came up to me with tears in their eyes saying, 'Thank you.' There's so much shame about mental illness in our country and so many stereotypes about women being 'crazy' or 'psycho.

If you just freestyle, everybody is gonna go, 'Freestyle.
If I'm on set and there's no other option, I get on a treadmill, but that's my most hated thing.

If you've got aspirations to be a manager or coach, obviously coaching your country would be a great honour.
I'm on the cover of the lingerie football swimsuit calendar this year.
I'm privileged to have had some success, but I've never forgotten what it was like to queue for a half-crown gallery seat for 'Oliver!' which is why I ensure that there are Ã‚Â£20 day tickets for 'Miss Saigon' and that the balconies in my theatres are as comfortable as I can possibly make them.
In grammar school, I didn't talk. Everybody said I was the invisible one. I'm still very shy.
I'm saying nobody's got the guts to be a J. Cole. Nobody's got the guts to be a Kendrick Lamar. We need more of them... Everybody wants to go the easy route.

I'm a fan of J. Cole.
I'm still bald, I just wear a toupee.
I'm just happy to be sitting right here in Chicago and right here at U.S. Cellular Field, holding my Hall of Fame press conference. I'm proud of that.

In previous generations, there was purpose; you had to die, but there was God, and literature and culture would go on. Now, there is no God, and our species is imminently doomed, so there is no purpose. We get up, raise families, have bank accounts, fix our teeth and everything else. But really, there is utterly no purpose except to be alive.
I'm not a big video game dude though, but I like 'Madden.
In the family, writing wasn't anything anyone understood - being a writer in the real world? How could it be? We didn't have those mirrors.
If you take five wickets, someone has to take the catches. If you score a hundred, someone has to be there with you. You haven't done it individually. Some contributions may be small, but they are still tangible. You have to look at it from a team point of view. When you start looking at it as an individual, then you have no team.

Right before I start the putter back, I think about making solid contact. This brings your attention to the back of the ball and helps keep your head still at impact, which is a must. Many amateurs take a peek down the line too soon, and that can cause all sorts of mis-hits.

The Choirboys' is very much a product of its mid-1970s time, especially in its two-dimensional portrayals of cop groupies Ora Lee and Carolina Moon, but the energy of Wambaugh's newfound, blackly comedic voice is a revelation, a trap-door opening into all facets of a policeman's world.
Roots' did show that the audience would be receptive to black talent and a black story.

Texas has long been known as the nation's largest energy producer, but we are equally proud of our distinction as the nation's leading energy innovator.
Texas is really special in that we have our own music scene, our own music chart. It's almost a genre on its own. It feels like you can make a great living just touring the state because it's so big, but eventually, I wanted a new challenge.
Texas is so wrapped up in myth and legend, it's hard to know what the state and its people are really about. Real Texans, raised on these myths and legends, sometimes become legends themselves.

Ted Geisel was trying to make a statement about awareness and personal responsibility. He was very clear about that. But the ideas and themes in 'The Lorax' go beyond a love of trees. It's also a story about the dangers of greed and the power of redemption. That's what makes it a timeless tale.

That's What She Said' is not Hollywood's standard picture of women: preternaturally gorgeous, wedding obsessed, boy crazy, fashion focused, sexed up 'girl' women.

U.S. leadership has been rooted not just in our own belief in American exceptionalism but in the faith of others around the world.

What a fantastic honour to be given the opportunity to write a column in the first ever 'Sunday Sun.
There's never been a moment where I sat down at my drawing board and thought, 'I'm a pro!
Things go bad after a divorce and often stay that way. It is rare for the parties to return placidly to a time before they met. A bitterness lingers on. Those who call this our Independence Day, fantasising of returning to a never-never time before they married, when they were free, easy, single, and master of their fate, are delusional.

We live in a quick-fix society where we need instant gratification for everything. Too fat? Get lipo-sucked. Stringy hair? Glue on extensions. Wrinkles and lines?

When you're working with a producer, there has to be chemistry.
Whenever I ask Siri for directions or a recommendation, I also ask her a trick question. Her answers are usually wacky. She scolds me for cursing, which I love, but she has no problem with ethics.

Well, I am not afraid of the word 'liberal.
Women are the real reason we get up every day. I'm talking about real men. If there were no women, I would not even have to bathe, because why would I care? These are guys I'm hanging with. I wake up for a woman every day of my life to make it happen for her.

I'm in a really nice position because I can be selective with the modeling jobs that I do and just work with brands I'm passionate about.

Our passionate preoccupation with the sky, the stars, and a God somewhere in outer space is a homing impulse. We are drawn back to where we came from.
